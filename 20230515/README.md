### Zheng, W., Gilleaudeau, G. J., Algeo, T. J., et al. 2023.  Mercury isotope evidence for recurrent photic-zone euxinia triggered by enhanced terrestrial nutrient inputs during the Late Devonian mass extinction. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 613, 118175.

## **Background/背景**
### The organic-rich black shale from the Frasnian-Famennian mass extension was an essential event deposition in the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary (DCB), which is thought to be caused by deoxygenation.
